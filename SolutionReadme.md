#### Exploratory Data Analysis Assignment 1

## The solution consists of 5 R Scripts and 4 PNG files

## 1. DataRetriever.R - A helper R script for retrieving data. This copies
##                      the downloaded file to data directory
## 2. Plot1.R - Draws Plot1 to Plot1.png file in the img directoy
## 3. Plot2.R - Draws Plot2 to Plot2.png file in the img directoy
## 4. Plot3.R - Draws Plot3 to Plot3.png file in the img directoy
## 5. Plot4.R - Draws Plot4 to Plot4.png file in the img directoy

#### Procedure for creating the plots

## 1. setwd("directory in which to download the scripts"). This directory
## should have enough memory to download the file.

## 2. source("Plot1.R") - This creates 2 directories if they do not exist
##      a. data directory to download and extract the file
##      b. img directory to store the resulting png file
##      c. Draws the plot and stores it as Plot1.png in the img directory

## 3. source("Plot2.R") - This creates 2 directories if they do not exist
##      a. data directory to download and extract the file
##      b. img directory to store the resulting png file
##      c. Draws the plot and stores it as Plot2.png in the img directory
##

## 4. source("Plot3.R") - This creates 2 directories if they do not exist
##      a. data directory to download and extract the file
##      b. img directory to store the resulting png file
##      c. Draws the plot and stores it as Plot3.png in the img directory

## 5. source("Plot4.R") - This creates 2 directories if they do not exist
##      a. data directory to download and extract the file
##      b. img directory to store the resulting png file
##      c. Draws the plot and stores it as Plot4.png in the img directory
